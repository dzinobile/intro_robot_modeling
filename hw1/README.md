#Problem 1
#Run instructions
No need to run interactive mode
#Program inputs
Wheel radius: 0.3 [m]
Distance between wheels: 1.2 [m]
Left wheel speed: 2pi [rad/s]
Right wheel speed: pi [rad/s]
Inital position (x, y, theta): (0, 0, 0)
Time duration: 5 [s]
Time increment: 0.01 [s]

#Problem 2
#Run instructions
No need to run interactive mode. Program is slow, give it some time to run. Program creates an animation of the robot tracing a circle. When this animation is complete, close out of the animation and the angle/angle velocities plots will appear. 
#Program inputs
path radius: 20 cm
path duration: 30 seconds
link 1 length: 15 cm
link 2 length: 15 cm
link 3 length: 2 cm
theta1 initial: 0.93 radians (calculated based on 3/4/5 right triangle)
theta2 initial: -1.86 radians
theta3 iniitial: 0.93 radians
end effector angle always = 0
