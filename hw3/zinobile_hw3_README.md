#Run instructions
Run as normal, program may take a few minutes to complete. Close out of plots as they appear to continue program. 
#Outputs:
-validation of transformation matrices
-plot of trajectory of end effector
-PPrint values of end effector trajectory
-PPrint parametric gravity matrix
-Plot of joint torques (friction negligible)
-Plot of joint torques (friction on pen considered)
